Quite a few months ago I was working on a personal project called: [mailwall.me](http://mailwall.me). The idea was a platform where you can share what you think someone will like using their mailwall.me address. As most people in the world have email, but not necessary a fb,twitter,whatsapp,etc. account, people can email media to people with a mailwall.me account. The message would get parsed, media extracted and displayed in the proper way on the platform. You could tie it up with [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com) to mail you on social media events and it would automatically categorize everything accordingly. This history posts scroller is an artifact of this project. I was looking for a new way to create a historical overview of the messages.

The [code](https://github.com/jestersimpps/angular-history-scroll) is a work in progress and haven't tested it anymore. I was going to make a generic version of it, but didn't find the time.
